## Introduction
### About CHIIA
The Chinese Investment in Australia (CHIIA) Database is a public database of Mainland Chinese direct commercial investment in Australia. The database was created and is maintained by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Crawford School of Public Policy at The Australian National University.

### About this project
CHIIA-NLP project is to identify the relevant data for CHIIA database by using natural language process and machine learning models which calculate the likelihood between the data extracted from Factiva and the relevant datasets. Our project will automatically search for the most obvious relevant data, and save them to CHIIA database. The project will greatly reduce the workload (~300 hours per year) and costs (thousands of dollars per year) for our clients.

## Risk Assessment

| Risks     | Potential Costs    | Mitigation  |
| :-------------- |:----------------:| :----------------------------------------:|
| Team        | Extra uncertainty project outcomes  | Enhance team cooperation and communication, and try to avoid team member turnover.  |
| Organizational Environment       | Impact project performance  | Stabilize the organization environment, and get informed of changing organizational support in advance.   |
| Requirements        | Time and resources for useless system | Continue to communicate with clients, and get correct, clear, adequate and usable requirements.      |
